I'm a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for building products that make a real impact. My journey began at Northeastern University, where I participated in the renowned co-op program, gaining hands-on experience at HqO (commercial real estate management software) and Lexia Learning (educational technology).

During my time at Northeastern, I was actively involved in Code4Community, a student-led group building technical solutions for local nonprofits. I contributed to [Tree Boston](https://treeboston.org), specifically developing their interactive [tree mapping platform](https://map.treeboston.org) that helps communities track and care for urban trees. I also worked with Generate, helping entrepreneurs launch technical products, including the initial development of [Shownxt](https://www.shownxt.com), a platform redefining college athletics recruiting.

Today, I'm a founding team member at Motive, where I've built and maintain a comprehensive CMS platform serving hundreds of dealerships and hundreds of thousands of customers monthly. I specialize in creating scalable component libraries and thrive on cross-functional collaboration with engineering, product, and design teams.

I love building products with a human touch—especially UIs that people use daily. My approach combines technical expertise with a deep understanding of user needs, ensuring every solution I create delivers real value.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing basketball, swimming, or discovering new house music. I'm passionate about travel (having flown twice the Earth's circumference in the last two years) and excited about the future of wearables and AR/VR technology. As a Formula 1 enthusiast, I see incredible potential for tech integration in motorsports. Currently based in Manhattan, I'm always learning—currently diving deeper into Next.js. Oh, and I share my home with 7 Shih Tzus, which keeps life interesting!

My philosophy is simple: technology should serve people, making daily tasks easier and more enjoyable.
