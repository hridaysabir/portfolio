I am an international student from Mumbai, India. I'm completing my B.S in Computer Science and Business from Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I've always held a keen interest for the intersection of Software and Business, trying to understand and be involved in the technological revolution taking place around us, where software is driving all kinds of change.

To this end, I've worked at HqO, a commercial real estate tenant experience platform as a Full-Stack Engineer, where I got the opportunity to contribute to software that had a consumer touch point with the tenants of commercial buildings across the United States.

I'm currently also working at Lexia Learning, where I have the opportunity to contribute to education technology, empowering young learners to read and write better as a JavaScript Engineer, working on client and internal tools for mobile and web platforms.

Apart from my career, I have an assorted set of interests, ranging from Formula 1, the NBA, Investing and Podcasting/Blogging!
