I’m a full-stack engineer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development. I’ve worked extensively with frameworks like React, NextJS, and Ruby on Rails to deliver dynamic, user-focused solutions. From building reusable component libraries to optimizing workflows that enhance user engagement, I thrive on creating impactful tools that solve real-world problems.

Collaboration is at the heart of my approach—I’ve worked closely with cross-functional teams to implement solutions that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. I’m passionate about bridging technical expertise with practical outcomes, ensuring that every project I contribute to delivers value for both users and administrators.
